# Today My Blog Starts

Hi there! I intend to publish some useful stuff and tricks around `PHP` I encountered
in my practice. It'll be mainly short posts related to `Symfony Framework` and its
ecosystem like `Doctrine`, `Twig`, bundles, etc with a nice code-blocks inserts.

So fell free to subscribe if you're interesting! I'll be very happy if my posts
will be useful or interesting for somebody else :).
